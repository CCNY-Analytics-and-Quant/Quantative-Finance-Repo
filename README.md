### Jean Batista & Alex Guerrero

Welcome to our Quantitative Finance repository for the Fall 2023 semester. This repository contains the projects and resources for this course. Below we highlight the three projects with a brief overview.

## Project 1 - [Portfolio Analysis](https://github.com/CCNY-Analytics-and-Quant/Portfolio-analysis-2)

Description: This project explores different metrics to help construct a risk analysis on seven stocks. We include metrics such as volatility, beta, returns, correlation, covariance, and even sharpe ratio when comparing them to major ETFs. Overall the goal is to display a risk analysis of equally weighted weighted stocks. In addition, another goal was to display the correlation matrix highlighting the correlation between the ours stocks and the 3 ETFs.

Note: Project one has its own repository. Currently working on moving it to this repository.

## Project 2 - [Efficient Frontier](Efficient-Frontier)

Description: This project explore the concenpt of the Efficient Frontier and portfolio optimization. We explore how our selection of seven assets by calculating their individual risk/return value. Furthermore, these results get combined into the efficient frontier. The code implements and analayzes an efficient portfolio. 

## Project 3 - [Final Project](Final-Project)

Description: The final project is a collaboration of previous projects. This notebook shows how we created an effective trading strategy and backtest the data to check the performance of the algorithm. We used Berry Cox's price momentum factors to select basket of assets for a long-short portfolio.
